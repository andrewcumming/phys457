## Born approximation continued

**General properties**. We can look at the limits of 

$$f(\theta,\phi) =  - {\mu\over 2\pi\hbar^2} \int d^3\mathbf{r}^\prime \, e^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}^\prime} V(\mathbf{r}^\prime)$$

at low and high energy. For low energy $q\rightarrow 0$, the scattering becomes **isotropic**

$$f(\theta,\phi) \xrightarrow[q\rightarrow 0]{}  - {\mu\over 2\pi\hbar^2} \int d^3\mathbf{r}^\prime \, V(\mathbf{r}^\prime)\sim -{\mu V_0 a^3\over \hbar^2}\hspace{1cm}\mathrm{independent\ of\ angle}$$

where $a$ is the range of the potential.

For large $q$, high energy, the phase $\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}^\prime$ oscillates rapidly in the exponent, so most of the integrand will cancel. The only coherent contribution is from the region where $\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}^\prime\lesssim \pi$ which corresponds to small angles where $k a\theta\lesssim \pi$. This implies **forward scattering** at high energies.

**Spherically-symmetric potential**. With a spherically-symmetric potential $V(r)$, we can do the angular integration.

**Yukawa potential and Rutherford scattering**.

**Validity of Born approximation.** The conditions for the validity of the Born approximation are discussion at the end of section 13.2 of Townsend and in problem 13.3 which is on Homework 10. The assumption we made was that the scattered wave is small compared to the incident wave in the volume covered by the scattering potential. For a finite spherical well of depth $V_0$ and radius $a$, the condition is 

$${\mu V_0 a^2\over \hbar^2} \ll 1.$$ 

The physical interpretation of this condition is that the potential well must be too shallow to have any bound states (compare with our earlier "back of the envelope" estimates for potential wells).
