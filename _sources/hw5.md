# Homework 5

This homework is due on Tuesday February 13th. You should submit a PDF of your solutions on myCourses.

1. (a) Calculate $\braket{r}$ and $\braket{r^2}$ for an electron in a hydrogen atom with maximal angular momentum $\ell=n-1$ and determine the uncertainty in position

$$\Delta r = \sqrt{\braket{r^2}-\braket{r}^2}.$$

(b) Use your result for $\braket{r}$ to write the energy in terms of $\braket{r}$.

(c) Use the results from this question to comment on the classical limit. 


2. (a) Show that in terms of the variables $\rho = r\sqrt{\mu\omega/\hbar}$ and $\lambda= 2E/\hbar\omega$, the radial part of the wavefunction of the 3D harmonic oscillator is given by the differential equation

$${d^2 u\over d\rho^2} -{\ell (\ell+1)\over \rho^2} u - \rho^2 u = -\lambda u,$$

where we have written $\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = r^{-1} u(r) Y_{\ell m}$.

(b) Explain why it makes sense to look for a solution of the form

$$u = \rho^{\ell+1} e^{-\rho^2/2} f(\rho).$$

(c) Develop a power law solution for $u(\rho)$, derive the recurrence relation for the polynomial coefficients, and explain how it results in quantization of the energy levels of the oscillator.
