# Lecture 9 Feb 1

Today we'll work through the hydrogen atom wavefunctions and the energy levels:

```{admonition} Discussion: wavefunctions and energy levels of hydrogen

We know how $u(r)$ behaves in the $r\rightarrow 0$ and $r\rightarrow\infty$ limits. We can use this to sketch the possible radial wavefunctions for different values of $\ell$.

Now consider the ground state ($n=1$). What will the wavefunction look like, ie. what will be the $\ell$ value and the shape of the radial wavefunction?

What about the first excited state ($n=2$)? Second excited state ($n=3$)? 

What is the degeneracy? (How many states are there as a function of $n$?)
```

## How this works mathematically: Laguerre polynomials



```{admonition} Exercise: size of atom

Consider the state with $\ell = n-1$, i.e. with maximal angular momentum for a given $n$. Explain why this simplifies the form of the radial part of the wavefunction. Compute the radius which maximises the probability density $r^2|\Psi|^2$ for this state. Write your answer in terms of $a_0$, $Z$ and $n$.
