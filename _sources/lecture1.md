# Lecture 1 Jan 4

This course follows on directly from PHYS 357 Quantum Physics I last term where you looked at 

- spin 1/2 particles
- angular momentum in quantum mechanics, including the idea of symmetries <-> conserved quantities
- time evolution through the Hamiltonian
- how to deal with 2-particle states (spin singlet and triplet)
- particles moving in 1D potentials $V(x)$, including the harmonic oscillator

In this course, we will push ahead into the second half of Townsend's book. The overall goal is to begin to tackle "real" systems by looking at

- what happens when we go into >1D: the two-body problem, bound states of central potentials, the hydrogen atom
- problems that we can't solve exactly: perturbation theory
- the effects of identical particles
- scattering 
- interaction of charged particles with electromagnetic radiation
