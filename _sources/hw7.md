# Homework 7

This homework is due on Tuesday February 27th. You should submit a PDF of your solutions on myCourses. [Note that we'll have a break from homework until after reading week so you can get ready for the midterm. Homework 8 will come out on March 12 and will be due on March 19].


1. Do Townsend 11.1 on the anharmonic oscillator.

2. An infinite square well between $x=-a$ and $x=a$ is perturbed by a potential $V_1(x) = \lambda x/a$, where $\lambda\ll 1$. Show that to first order in $\lambda$, (a) the energy levels are unchanged, whereas (b) the ground state wavefunction is changed. Derive an expression for the ground state wavefunction $\psi(x)$ that includes the first order correction, evaluating all necessary integrals. Make a plot of $\psi(x)$ and compare with the original ground state wavefunction, explaining whether the difference makes sense physically.

3. Do Townsend 11.16 on evaluating $\langle 1/r \rangle$ for the hydrogen atom.
