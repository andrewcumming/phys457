# PHYS 457 Honours Quantum Physics 2: Winter 2024 Course outline

## Description and goals

This course follows on from PHYS 357 Honours Quantum Physics 1, covering topics such as 2D and 3D quantum systems, perturbation theory, scattering, and the interaction of matter and radiation.

## Instructor and TAs

Prof. [Andrew Cumming](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~cumming/), andrew.cumming@mcgill.ca, Rutherford 310.

TAs: Clément Fortin, Renee Goodman, Ivan Martinez

## Time and place

Class will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1-2.30pm in Rutherford 114.

The first class is Thursday January 4th.


## List of topics

We will cover Chapters 8 onwards of Townsend, including:

- Path integrals
- The two-body problem, bound states of central potentials, the H atom
- Perturbation theory
- Identical particles
- Scattering
- The interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation

## Useful books and other resources

Following PHYS 357, we will use the book "A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics" by Townsend (2012, second edition).

Townsend's book is all you will need to complete the course, but I encourage you to read widely on the topics we will cover. Some suggested readings will be posted as appropriate during the course. There are many excellent textbooks on quantum mechanics that you can look at. An excellent book is [The Physics of Quantum Mechanics](https://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/JamesBinney/QBhome.htm) by Binney and Skinner (you'll find a downloadable PDF of an earlier version of the book on their webpage).


## Office hours

I will have an office hour on **Wednesday at noon** in my office **ERP 310**. I encourage you to come and talk to me about any questions you have about the course or just generally about quantum topics if you don't have any specific questions in mind.  I am also available to answer questions directly after class on Tuesdays or Thursdays.

The TAs will hold a weekly "debug den" on **TBD**

## Evaluation

Homeworks 30%, and either (1) midterm 30%, final exam 40% or (2) final exam 70%, whichever gives you the best grade. When calculating the homework component of the final grade, each homework will count equally, and the two lowest scoring homeworks will be dropped to help your grade.

Homeworks will be weekly, due on Tuesday 11:59pm each week.  *The homeworks are a key part of learning the material and will prepare you for the exams.* Late submissions will not be accepted. If you run out of time, please submit whatever you can before the deadline.

The midterm will be held in class on **Tuesday March 12** (this is week after reading week). The final exam will be a 72-hour take home exam during the final exam period. 

Course materials such as lecture notes and problem sets will be made available on the course website at 

https://andrewcumming.github.io/phys457/intro.html

Homeworks will be submitted in PDF format on myCourses. Grades will be distributed in myCourses. Questions about the homework grading should first be discussed with the TA who graded that particular problem set.


## McGill policy statements

McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic oﬀences under the [Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures](https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/code_of_student_conduct_and_disciplinary_procedures.pdf) (approved by Senate on 29 January 2003) (See McGill's guide to academic honesty](https://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest) for more information).

In accord with McGill University's [Charter of Students' Rights](https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/charter_of_student_rights_last_approved_october_262017.pdf), students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French written work that is to be graded. This does not apply to courses in which acquiring proficiency in a language is one of the objectives.

In the event of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University's control, the content and/or evaluation scheme in this course is subject to change. 

Additional policies governing academic issues which aﬀect students can be found in the [McGill Charter of Students' Rights](https://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/files/secretariat/charter_of_student_rights_last_approved_october_262017.pdf).
