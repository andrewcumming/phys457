# Lecture 19 Mar 19

Last time, we discussed:

- multiparticle states, e.g. $\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}$ describes a state in which particle 1 is in a spin-up state and particle 2 is spin-down
- The *particle exchange operator* $\hat{P}_{12}$, which switches the two particle labels, e.g. $\hat{P}_{12}\ket{\uparrow\downarrow} = \ket{\downarrow\uparrow}$, ie. returns a state in which particle 1 is now in a spin-down state and particle 2 is spin-up.
- Because we have *indistinguishable particles* in quantum mechanics, the allowed multiparticle states are either *symmetric* or *antisymmetric* under the exchange of any two particle labels. For two spin-1/2 particles, the symmetric states are $\ket{\uparrow\uparrow}$, $(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}+\ket{\downarrow\uparrow})/\sqrt{2}$ and $\ket{\downarrow\downarrow}$ and the antisymmetric state is $(\ket{\uparrow\downarrow}-\ket{\downarrow\uparrow})/\sqrt{2}$. You may recognize these states from the quantum 1 course: the symmetric states correspond to the eigenstates of total spin $\hat{S} =\hat{S}_1 + \hat{S}_2$  with $s=1$ (triplet states, $m_s=-1,0,+1$), whereas the antisymmetric state has $s=0$ (singlet state, $m_s=0$).
- The *spin-statistics theorem* tells us that identical fermions have  antisymmetric states with respect to particle interchange, whereas bosons have symmetric states.

Today we'll apply these ideas to the helium atom.

## Further reading

- Townsend 11.5 and 11.6 has a lot more detail on fine structure if you are interested.
- We're starting Townsend Chapter 12 and will talk about the helium atom next time.
