# Lecture 16 Feb 27

Today we discussed:

- the symmetry of the hydrogen Hamiltonian under parity ($[\hat{H},\hat{P}]=0$) and how that implies that the stationary states do not have a dipole moment, $\braket{n, \ell, m|\hat{z}|n,\ell, m}=0$.
- no intrinsic dipole moment means that we should see a quadratic Stark effect. The dipole moment is induced by the applied electric field, $\mathbf{p} = \alpha \mathbf{E}$ where $\alpha$ is the polarizability. The energy is then $-\int \alpha E \ dE = -(1/2)\alpha |\mathbf{E}|^2$. 
- nonetheless, we see a linear Stark effect for the $n=2$ states. This is because we have a degenerate subspace. Any linear combination of the $n=2$ states is a stationary state, and we can choose linear combinations that have a dipole moment. This gives a linear energy shift in the applied electric field, $-p_0 E$, where $p_0$ is the dipole moment associated with the new eigenstates. 
- This is an example of symmetry breaking: the Hamiltonian is symmetric under parity, but in a degenerate subspace we can construct stationary states that break the symmetry, i.e. do not have a definite parity.
- The double potential well as an example of symmetry breaking. 
- The ammonia molecule as a similar example, and what happens in more complicated molecules.
- The idea that perfect degeneracy is not always required to apply degenerate perturbation theory.
