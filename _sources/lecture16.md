# Lecture 16 Feb 27

Today we discussed:

- the symmetry of the hydrogen Hamiltonian under parity and how that implies that the stationary states do not have a dipole moment
- no intrinsic dipole moment means that we should see a quadratic Stark effect
- nonetheless, we see a linear Stark effect for the $n=2$ states. This is because we have a degenerate subspace. Any linear combination of the $n=2$ states is a stationary state, and we can choose linear combinations that have a dipole moment. This gives a linear energy shift in the applied electric field. There is symmetry breaking.
- The double potential well as an example of symmetry breaking. 
- The ammonia molecule as a similar example, and what happens in more complicated molecules.
- The idea that perfect degeneracy is not always required to apply degenerate perturbation theory.
