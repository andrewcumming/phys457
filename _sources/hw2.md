# Homework 2

This homework is due on Tuesday January 23rd. You should submit a PDF of your solutions on myCourses.

1. (a) Apply the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to estimate the ground state energy and wave-function spread of the harmonic oscillator, using arguments similar to those given in class for the hydrogen atom. Explain whether you get the answer you expect or not.  
(b) Consider a 1D finite square well with depth $V_0$ and width $a$. Estimate the minimal kinetic energy of a particle with mass $m$ confined to a distance $a$. For what values of $a$ does the kinetic energy exceed $V_0$? How do you reconcile your answer with the fact that 1D finite square wells *always* have a bound state, for *all* values of $a$, $m$, and $V_0$?
2. Townsend 9.5.
3. Townsend 9.7.
4. Townsend 9.8.



Hint for Townsend 9.7: the cross product of two vectors is given in terms of $\epsilon_{ijk}$ by $(\vec{A}\times\vec{B})_i = \epsilon_{ijk} A_jB_k$.  

Hint for the last part of 1(b): Draw a rough sketch of the wavefunction you expect for the bound state.
